To create the app I have used [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/index.html) which is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.

I'm also deploying the model using Streamlit. To make this all work I have different files in the same repository:

- [my_app.py](https://github.com/renoneto/fourth_module_project/blob/main/my_app.py): the streamlit app.

- [functions.py](https://github.com/renoneto/fourth_module_project/blob/main/functions.py): contains custom functions created for the app.

- [requirements.txt](https://github.com/renoneto/fourth_module_project/blob/main/requirements.txt): required python libraries and versions to run the app. I have kept only what's necessary to run the app, otherwise, I'd install a lot more than I needed.
